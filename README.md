# Pacman!

This is a video I found on youtube.

It goes through visually how to code a simple Pacman game and explains nothing.  I wanted to give this a go so I could see how multiple js files can work together on a single project.  This is also my first game so it's giving me an opportunity to see how game specific code works.
